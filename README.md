# Gavetology

Shelf management application made in React+Typescript, started from a Vite template.

## Why the project "Gavetology"?

I have shelves full of parts for my electronics projects. It would be cool to have a search engine for my shelves. I think you could use it too. Thus, I am releasing this project for everyone to use.

## Why the name "Gavetology"?

"Gaveta" in Portuguese means "drawer". Therefore inasmuch insofar, this project intends to be a study in drawer organization methods.
